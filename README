mymkr is a set of bash scripts that create and managage a custom development
environment and package installation location for compiled sources.  mymkr
makes it easy to compile specific versions of software with specific features
enabled or disaled and installs them in a configured directory enabling a
developer to install and use multiple versions of the same software in their own
user space without polluting the host system.

INSTALLATION:
) git clone mymkr

) Put mymkr where you want it (the default is ~/.mymkr)
  Example: /x/mymkr
  :NOTE: This step is optional, the mymkr directory can live anywhere.

) Edit mymkr/mymaker.env, change MYMKR_PREFIX to the location of your directory.
  Example: MYMKR_PREFIX=/x

) To use the packages installed in the directory, source the environment file:
  $ source /x/mymkr/mymaker.env

) If you want automatic sourcing, put this line in your ~/.bashrc:
  source /x/mymkr/mymaker.env
